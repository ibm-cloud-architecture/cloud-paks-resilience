# IBM Cloud Private

## Install IBM Cloud Private on OpenShift
Version: 3.2.0
ICP for OpenShift
* Part Number: CC1W3EN

Documentation: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.2.0/supported_environments/openshift/install_openshift.html

Notice you need to install ICP from one of the OpenShift nodes

## Notes

Even though IKS provisions now an OpenShift cluster, it doesn't give SSH connection to neither the masters nor the workers, so I couldn't install ICP on an IKS OpenShift cluster
